# Credit-Card-Analysis

PowerBI Dashboard
Summary:
- Imported CSV data into PostgreSQL, creating and managing `debit_card_detail` and `cust_detail` tables to ensure accurate data mapping and integrity
- Designed and implemented SQL databases, handling data ingestion and ensuring efficient querying
- Developed DAX calculations in Power BI, using `SWITCH` and arithmetic functions to enhance data analysis capabilities
- Built interactive Power BI dashboards with dynamic filtering and drill-down features to visualize key metrics and trends in debit card usage and customer demographics

SQL and Database Management:
Designed and Created SQL Tables:
Developed and implemented cc_detail and cust_detail tables in PostgreSQL to manage credit card and customer data.
Defined appropriate data types and constraints to ensure data integrity and optimize performance.
Data Ingestion:
Utilized the COPY command to efficiently import large datasets from CSV files into PostgreSQL tables, ensuring accurate data mapping and integrity.
Date Formatting:
Configured PostgreSQL to handle dd-mm-yyyy date formats using SET datestyle = 'ISO, DMY'; to ensure correct date parsing and storage.

Power BI Dashboard Development:
Interactive Dashboards:
Designed and implemented interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends in credit card usage and customer demographics.
Integrated SQL data with DAX-calculated columns to provide real-time insights and support data-driven decision-making.
Data Visualization:
Employed various visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables to represent complex data in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.
Enabled dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities to allow stakeholders to explore data at different levels of granularity.
